# Learn To Use Linux!

learntouselinux.com (often referred to as "ltul") is a community project for teaching people how to use Linux, and as a project framework for teaching ourselves how to be better teammates, project and product managers, and infrastructure engineers. 

Over time this project will have many evolutions, each of which should be able to stand alone as an entire site. These evolutions will be captured as GitHub milestones. This will allow users to start with the basics, and learn how to scale out infrastructure and web applications at their own pace (independent of the pace of development of this project). 

## Project Goals
1. Teach people on the Internet how to use Linux
2. Teach ourselves new tools and technologies, project and product management skills
3. Build cool shit
